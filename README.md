Can I use clean architecture principles with the Xenko game engine? Let's find out!

Ideally I want to create a fully functional game that adheres to clean architecture principle.
This mainly means Xenko should remain a presenter and the data types should not leak through to the rest van my application.
I wonder how to work with basic data types that get passed around in large quantities and often.
Adapaters might become expensive in that case?
What will the performance impact be, if any?
What are other strengths and weaknesses I haven't thought off?

To be clear: like most of my public projects this is an experiment.
